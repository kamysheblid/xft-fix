# xft-fix
## Description 

The xft module for stumpwm is broken because it doesnt clear the
cache. This is a fix that creates a timer that will clear that cache
so it doesnt take up all the memory.

## Usage

Simply place into the modules directory, =load-module= it, then run
=main-loop=. It will clear the cache every 10 minutes.
	
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (load-module "xft-fix")
  ; start the main-loop
  (xft-fix:main-loop)
#+END_SRC

If you want to change the repeat timing simply change
=*clear-font-repeat*= and then execute the main-loop again.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
		(setq xft-fix:*clear-font-repeat* 20)
		(xft-fix:main-loop)
#+END_SRC

You can also insert a delay for the timer:
	
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
		(setq xft-fix:*clear-font-delay* 5)
		(xft-fix:main-loop)
#+END_SRC
